## Today's Agenda
1. Introductions
2. Review the syllabus and course website
3. Learn how to turn in homework
4. Setup IPython/Jupyter Notebook environment
5. Image and Audio I/O (Notebook)


## Readings 1

Read the [syllabus]({{ site.url | append:site.baseurl}}/syllabus) and the [homework]({{ site.url | append:site.baseurl}}/homework) pages. 

Read [Chapter 3](http://www.dspguide.com/CH3.PDF) of [_The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing_](http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm) by Steven W. Smith, Ph.D.


## Homework 1

Produce a sound file from image data or an image file from sound data. Try to condition and select the data to make the results as interesting as possible. Submit your results using the procedure described on the [Homework]({{ site.url }}/homework) page by 2017-04-11 0600.

Also, take a look at [PixiVisor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AcXzG6NzF0) and [VOSIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxdKCItpq9g) for inspiration.

Consider reviewing [_Raster Scanning: A New Approach to Image Sonification, Sound Visualization, Sound Analysis And Synthesis_](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~woony/publications/Yeo_Berger-ICMC06.pdf) from ICMC 2006. This is optional.
