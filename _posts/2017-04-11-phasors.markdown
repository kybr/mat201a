## Homework 2

(due 2017-04-18 0600)

Use image data as a spectrum on which you perform an Inverse Fourier Transform. i.e. Load an image and interpret each column (or row if you prefer) of pixel data as values of the FFT bins in an Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Then, produce audio from these many STFTs by taking the IFT of each in succussion.

The main complication in this assignment is segmenting the image pixels into the right shape and size for the IFT. You may interpret the pixels as the magnitude spectrum or as the real and/or complex part of the complex spectrum.

See Aphex Twin's track ["Equation"](https://youtu.be/M9xMuPWAZW8?t=300). Also consider using some of the images you found in [_Raster Scanning: A New Approach to Image Sonification, Sound Visualization, Sound Analysis And Synthesis_](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~woony/publications/Yeo_Berger-ICMC06.pdf).

Try to prepare the input image so you get an interesting result.
