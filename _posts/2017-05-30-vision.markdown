## What
- Acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions.
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision>
- Computers are generally programmed for particular tasks
- but methods based on learning are increasingly common
- Single frame and multi-frame
- High level Representations

## Tasks
- Recognition
  + Object recognition
    * learned objects are found in an image
  + Identification
    * A known object can be identified
    * e.g. faces, fingerprints, writing
    * Shape identification and coding: 2D and 3D, movement and occlusion
- Detection
  + Find paticular details or abnormalities
- Techniques
  + Scale Invariant feature transform (SIFT)
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform>
  + Eigenfaces
    * Averaging faces probabilistically
    * Good at identifying faces
  + Haar cascades
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_features>
    * Good at telling where in a picture a face is
  + Model estimation
    * Skeleton tracking
  + Gesture Recognition
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesture_recognition>
- Motion Analysis
  + Motion
    * Feature identification and association
    * From a set of images captured with time separation
    * Heuristics to help matching ![]({{ site.url | append:site.baseurl}}/image/motion_heuristics.png)
  + Tracking
  + Own motion
  + Optical flow
    * Both of the above
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow>
    * <https://vimeo.com/36466564>
    * <https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf>
  + Scene Reconstruction
  + Image restoration/Stitching
  + Machine Learning
    * Pattern recognition and
    * Interpretations based on prior experience
  + Desicion Making
    * Should automatic action be taken from the analysis?
