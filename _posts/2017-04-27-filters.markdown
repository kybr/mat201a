#### Audio Clips

For the exercise today...

#### [Z-transform][]

Here's a decent book chapter on the Z-transform: [Basics of z-Transform
Theory](http://ask.fxplus.ac.uk/tools/HELM/pages/workbooks_1_50_jan2008/Workbook21/21_2_bscs_z_trnsfm_thry.pdf).

Read also, [Intuitively speaking, what does a Z-transform represent?](https://www.quora.com/Intuitively-speaking-what-does-a-z-transform-represent).

> So a z-Transform is (in the most basic intuitive sense) a description of how to functionally build a system out of delay blocks.

#### [(Analog) Filter Primer][]
> Abstract: This comprehensive article covers all aspects of analog filters. It first addresses the basic types: first- and second-order filters, highpass and lowpass filters, notch and all-pass filters, and high-order filters. The tutorial then explains the characteristics of the different implementations, such as Butterworth filters, Chebychev filters, Bessel filters, elliptic filters, state-variable filters, and switched-capacitor filters.
