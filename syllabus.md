Processing multi-media data is at the core of today's digital world. From image data mining through computer vision to audio processing and compression for Internet telephony, media signal processing is as ubiquitous as it is inconspicuous. This course hopes to serve as an introduction to the field of processing sound, image and video, from a theoretical perspective, but firmly grounded in practical applications and demonstrations. This course will explore fundamental concepts in digital signal processing, multimedia signal processing, and multimedia representations. It will deal with topics like audio and image filtering and feature extraction, gestural input and computer vision.


## Topics

- Reading and working with media formats
- Fast Fourier Transform and Convolution applied to audio and images
- LTI Filters: Theory and practical design
- Fundamentals of signal modeling and wavelets
- Feature extraction and matching
- Basics of computer vision and gesture analysis


## Software

Throughout this course, we will use Jupyter Notebook with IPython and several software libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. This free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS) stack is a powerful and popular toolbox among scientists, engineers, and professionals.
