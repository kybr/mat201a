In these later examples, when we run our notebook locally on our machine, the sample data and the sample rate are retained in the the notebook. In the case of `Audio('media/passport.wav')` there is an implicit variable assignment.\n",

    "When we copypaste the guts of our notebook into a gist, the sample data is in that gist and when that gist becomes a nbviewer.jupyter.org page, the sample data and sample rate are still there, ready to go into `IPython.display.Audio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `Audio(url = 'media/passport.wav')` no sample data is saved into the notebook. `IPython.display.Audio` must do it's work at runtime using the URL is is given. When that runtime is in a web page on nbviewer.jupyter.org, `IPython.display.Audio` cannot find 'media/passport.wav' which is on your laptop."
